# 🧠 Synthia Cloud Skills - Complete Suite Index

## System Overview

**Synthia v1.0** is a world-class autonomous frontend design + voice collaboration agent targeting Mexico City and quality design seekers. Self-hosted on Hostinger via Docker, synthesizing UDIP v2.1 ULTIMATE, OpenKombai design-to-code, Agent Lightning monitoring, and multi-agent coordination frameworks.

### System Map

**Core Products:**
- **OpenKombai Fork**: Figma-to-code conversion engine (React/Next.js component generation)
- **Design Agent**: Award-winning UI/UX creation following Awwwards standards
- **Voice Collaboration**: Real-time voice synthesis/recognition for team communication
- **Agent Monitoring**: Microsoft Agent Lightning for continuous learning and performance tracking

**Key Resources (Stocks):**
- Design patterns library (UI/UX Pro Max - 50+ styles, 97 palettes, 57 font pairings)
- Component templates (shadcn/ui, Motion Primitives, custom Synthia components)
- Agent learning data (daily reports from Awwwards.com trend analysis)
- Voice synthesis models (ElevenLabs, HeyGen integrations)
- Multi-agent coordination state (MCP Agent Mail, Beads, Gastown)

**Critical Flows:**
1. **Design Generation**: User request → Memory-first scan → Design system query → Component generation → Accessibility validation → Performance optimization
2. **Voice Collaboration**: Voice input → Transcription → Intent recognition → Agent coordination → Response synthesis → Voice output
3. **Learning Loop**: Awwwards scraping → Pattern extraction → Agent Lightning training → Skill refinement → Daily learning reports
4. **Deployment**: Code generation → Docker build → Hostinger deployment → Health monitoring → Performance tracking

**Feedback Loops:**
- Design quality → User feedback → Pattern refinement → Design system updates
- Agent performance → Learning reports → Skill optimization → Capability expansion
- Voice interactions → Transcription accuracy → Model fine-tuning → Response quality

**Leverage Points:**
- Memory-first coordination prevents conflicts and accelerates agent collaboration
- Design system hierarchy (MASTER.md + page overrides) enables consistent brand application
- MCP tool access (Puppeteer, curl, GitHub) eliminates human intermediation
- Real-time learning from Awwwards trends maintains cutting-edge capabilities

## 🤖 Automation Architecture

### Memory-First Coordination Layer

Every skill follows this pattern before execution:

```bash
# 1. Project and conversation scan
project_knowledge_search "relevant context"
conversation_search "prior decisions"
recent_chats n=5

# 2. Agent coordination check (if MCP Agent Mail available)
resource://inbox/$AGENT_NAME?project=$(pwd)&limit=20
file_reservation_paths --paths='["relevant/**"]' --exclusive=true

# 3. Design system hierarchy
cat design-system/MASTER.md
cat design-system/pages/{current-page}.md  # Overrides MASTER

# 4. Beads task context (if available)
bd show <task-id>
bd dep list <task-id>
bd ready

# 5. Only then execute skill logic
```

cd synthia

# Copy environment template
cp master.env .env

# Update .env with your actual API keys and tokens
nano .env

# Start Docker services
docker-compose up -d

# Initialize multi-agent coordination (if using)
export AGENT_NAME="SynthiaOrchestrator"
ensure_project --project_key="$(pwd)"
register_agent --project_key="$(pwd)" --agent_name="$AGENT_NAME"

# Initialize Beads task management
bd init

# Verify setup
docker ps  # Should show all Synthia services running
bd ready   # Should show task management initialized
resource://inbox/$AGENT_NAME?project=$(pwd)  # Should return empty inbox
```

### 2. Load Skills

```bash
# All skills are in /skills directory
ls skills/

# Each skill is self-contained markdown with:
# - skill_id
# - purpose and when_to_use
# - inputs/outputs specification
